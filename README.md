# Ironhack Projects

## Introduction

This repo contains all projects made during the Ironhack 2020|1st semester Data Analytics Fulltime Bootcamp.

These projects tell how was the growth from ground 0 in python to the end of a bootcamp experience, 3 months, 500 hours of intensive learning and many non slept nights later!

## Project 01

[The game challenge](https://github.com/serachung/ironhack_projects/tree/master/P01-game-challenge) was the first project in the course. It is a **Memory Game**, created using everything we learned during the first :

- emojis :) 
- *pandas*
- a lot of *for loops*

## Project 02

[Shark Attack](https://github.com/serachung/ironhack_projects/tree/master/P02-shark-attack) is basically data cleaning.

- *pandas*
- lambda funtion
- regex
- simple analysis

*[Here](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks) is the link to the Kaggle's dataset

## Projects 03 - 04

The 2 projects were based on the same theme: the Health Insurance Market in Brazil

| [`data gathering`](https://github.com/serachung/ironhack_projects/tree/master/P03-data-gathering) | [`data visualization`](https://github.com/serachung/ironhack_projects/tree/master/P04_data-visualization) |

- *pandas*
- Web scrapping (Beautiful Soup / Selenium)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Tableau
- Power Point

## Project 05

[Pricing Rick's Diamonds](https://github.com/serachung/ironhack_projects/tree/master/P05-linear-regression-project) is an unsupervised learning project, the goal is to estimate diamonds prices based on historical data.

- pandas / numpy - exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- scikitlearn library - linear regression and price prediction
- success metric: RMSE (root mean squared error)

## Project 06

[Young Preferences](https://github.com/serachung/ironhack_projects/tree/master/P06-unsupervised-clustering-project) is a clustering project (unsupervised) to identify preferences segmentation based on a dataset containing a survey with 150 responses from people from 15 to 30 years ( link to dataset [here](https://ironhack.school/asset-v1:IRONHACK+DAFT+202002_SAO+type@asset+block@responses.csv) )

- sklearn - partitioning techniques (K-means, DBScan) / hierarchical technique / PCA decomposition
- yellowbrick - K-elbow method, Silhouette visualizer

## Project 07

[Australia weather forecast](https://github.com/serachung/ironhack_projects/tree/master/P07-weather-forecast) is a supervised learning project, which consists of building a machine learning model that predicts if it's going to rain or not the next day, based on a historical dataset of 10 years of weather conditions. This project was made in a group of 4 people ( link to case github [here](https://github.com/aguiarandre/processo_cientista) )

- sklearn - Standard Scaler, train test split, Cross Validation, K-means, Agglomerative clustering, PCA decomposition, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest
- yellowbrick - K-elbow method, Silhouette visualizer
- LightGBM
- XGBoost

## Project 08

[Music recommendation system](https://github.com/serachung/ironhack_projects/tree/master/P08-grand-finale) is an unsupervised learning project, which consists of building a music recommendation system based on a preference. 

- Web-scrapping / API Wrapper
- sklearn - Standard Scaler, train test split, Cross Validation, K-means, Agglomerative clustering, PCA decomposition, 
- yellowbrick - K-elbow method, Silhouette visualizer
